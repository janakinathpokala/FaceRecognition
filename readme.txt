*JAVA program to slove the N-Queen problem using MIN_CONFLICT algorithm.

*The program will take input for n  4 (i.e. size of chess board is n  n) and the start state conguration (i.e., where each queen is located on each column) interactively from the user. Output of your program will be the location of n queens
on the chess board (one per column) such that no two queens attack each other.
