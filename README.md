# Face Recognition using Facenet transfer learning

# Introduction:
* Face recognitionÂ is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face.
* Face verification is used to verify the given face against a known identity(1:1 mapping).
* Face recognition is used to verify a given against a database of known faces(1:N mapping).

# Concepts:
* One shot Learning
* Siamese Network
* Triple Loss function

# Approach:
